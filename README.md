<h2>Background</h1>

My project will display the top 100 IMDB movies categorized by their genre. In each genre, a bar graph will display the ratings of each movie of that genre and the user will be able to click on a movie to learn more about that movie.

<h2>Functionality & MVPS</h2>

In Top 100 Movies By Genre, users will be able to:
<ul>
    <li>See a visual representation of each movie's rating through a horizontal bar chart</li>
    <li>Click on the genres on the side menu to view the ratings of each movie</li>
    <li>Click on each bar to view a modal that provides more information about that movie</li>
</ul>

In addition, this project will include:
<ul>
    <li>My GitHub link</li>
    <li>A README</li>
</ul>
